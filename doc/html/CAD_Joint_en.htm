<h2>Joints:</h2>
Joints are objects of submodels becoming exported into the parent model.
Joints using the code letter J.
  
Applications for Joints:

  <i>Assemblies, Schematics (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic)</i>
       Importing points as connecting points (<a href='#JP1'>example</a>)
       Import a reference-system (plane) for positioning a submodel.
  
  <i>Kinematics</i>
    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
  
  <i>Animation paths, Camera Drives</i>
    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

<h3>Joints on points:</h3>

  The corresponding object (point or plane)  is created automatically
    when inserting this model as external submodel -
    the object is imported in the parent model.
  Example:
    The current model is an electrical resistance;
    the connection points are defined as joints.
    When inserting the resistance as a submodel the
    Connection points automatically generate normal points.
    See sample_DiagEl1.gcad model.
    
# Export:
J1 = P20    # export point in subModel

# Import: (is created automatically by import of external submodel as M20)
P20=IMP M20 J1   # import Joint Nr.1  from subModel M20


Example:
- create model with points to connect (eg my_jnt1.gcad):
  - create a rectangle, create the connection-points
  - set the connention-points as JOINTS: 
    CAD create joint-export, sel point ..
  - store model as eg my_jnt1.gcad

- create model using external connection-points (eg my_jnt2.gcad):
  - load model with connection-points (eg my_jnt1.gcad)
    CAD Submodel "M external Model" my_jnt1.gcad, set position, OK.
    The connection-points have been created automatically - see MAN
  - the connection-points can be used as normal points ..
  - store model as eg my_jnt2.gcad

<h2>CAD-Functions Joints:</h2>

<h2>Joint-export</h2>
 Export the selected object of the current model as a joint.

   joint-object       select point or plane


<b>Output:</b>
J1 = P20

<h2>Joint-import</h2>

 Import an object of a Submodel.
 The Submodel-object must have been exported with Joint-export.

 <b>Attention:</b> all exported objects will be imported automatically 
   when creating a Submodel with (<a href="CAD_Model_de.htm#F0">M int.Model Submodel</a>)
 
 This interactive feature is only for the modification
   of joint-imports necessary.

<b>Submodel:</b>
  the Submodel from which the joint will be imported
  
<b>Joint:</b>
  J# (the joint in the Submodel)

<b>Text:</b>
  only for note-joints: the text that replaces the original text.



<b>Output:</b>
P20 = P20 M20 IMP
N20 = N20 M20 IMP "new text"

<h3>Joints on Notes:</h3>
       Text - redefine it for each inserted Submodel (<a href='#JN1'>example</a>)

  This allows to modify the text of the corresponding note -
    The text can be redefined when inserting this new model as Submodel.
  Example:
    The current model is an electrical resistance;
    a note with the resistance value is defined as a joint.
    When inserting this model, the resistance value can be redefined.
    See sample_DiagEl1.gcad model.
